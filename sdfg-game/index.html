    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>2023/10/12, this project has started. As a over 40GB 3D game project, it's realy hard for some noob studens to develop it in less than 1 year, so we need you support.</p>
    <br><hr><br>
    <p>In this game, you will see a 3D modle of No.3 Building of Jinan Zhengsheng School (also surroundings). You spawn as a student outside the building.Yes, you can choose the skin you like!</p>

    <h2>Step1: Build 3D modles</h2>
    <p>As for me, I am used to doing this by Cinema 4D. But we also don't mind 3D-Max, Rhino, Maya and some others.</p>
    <p>We need some modles of school supplies, such as desk, chair, blackbord. The pictures of these will be sent in discord, don't need very exact.</p>
    <p>We also need the modles of the building. The CAD file will also be sent in discord.</p>
    <p>You'd batter unfold the UV and draw</p>
